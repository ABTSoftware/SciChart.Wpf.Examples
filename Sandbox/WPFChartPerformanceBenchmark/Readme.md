# SCICHART WPF CHARTING PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK

This is the software used in the article [How Fast is SciChart's WPF Chart? DirectX vs. Software Comparison](https://www.scichart.com/how-fast-is-scichart-wpf-chart/). 

This article shows several test cases of SciChart's drawing performance, including:

 ### 1. NxM series test. 
 
 Displays 100 series x 100 points, then 500 x 500 and 1000 x 1000. Tests scichart under extremely high series counts

 ### 2. Scatter chart test. 
 
 Displays 1k scatter points, then 10k, 100k and finally 1 Million. Tests scichart's ability to display high counts on scatter charts.

 ### 3. FIFO chart test. 
 
 Displays 1k, 100k, 1M and 10M (million) points in a FIFO (First in first out) scrolling strip chart.

 ### 4. Append test. 
 
 Appends to a series in blocks of 100, 1k, 10k until millions of points are observed. Tests SciChart's big-data capabilities

# To run the application & benchmark performance 

 1. Open the WPFChartPerformanceBenchmark-SciChart_DirectX_vs_Software.sln

 2. Right click the solution node and Enable Nuget Package Restore. This is required to download the SciChart WPF DLLs. 
 
 **NOTE:** For NuGet Package restore, ensure you add the NUGet feed https://www.myget.org/F/abtsoftware/api/v3/index.json to your Visual Studio. Full instructions can be found at [SciChart | Getting Nightly Builds with NuGet](https://support.scichart.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/17232/37/getting-nightly-builds-with-nuget)

 3. Build in Release Mode 

 4. Run without debugger attached. Maximise the window and click 'Start'
 
 The application will run through a series of tests and will report the results to a grid at the bottom. 
 
 Numeric results are FPS (Frames per second). higher is better! 
 

# Note on Performance Improvements in SciChart WPF v5.1 

SciChart WPF v5.1 has a number of performance improvements to the line and scatter series types. 

In this demo the following performance optimisations are enabled:

  * Direct3D11RenderSurface (DirectX drawing) 
  * Extreme Drawing Manager for line series 
  * Extreme Resamplers for large datasets 

To learn more about these optimizations, and to learn how to enable them in your own applicaiton, check the following article: [Performance Improvements in SciChart WPF v5.1 ](https://www.scichart.com/performance-improvements-scichart-wpf-v5-1/)

# Troubleshooting!

We recommend performing a full Clean/Rebuild in release mode before running without debugger attached for best perf.
