  <ToolTipDescription>The ECG Monitor Demo showcases a real-time heart-rate monitor. This example uses MVVM and shows how to set the Axis VisibleRange and scroll the chart manually when the trace reaches the right edge. 
  A refresh rate of 50Hz is used and a shader effect is applied to provide a slight glow to the series to simulate the trace glow on an oscilloscope VDU.

  <Description>
    The ECG Monitor Demo showcases a real-time heart-rate monitor. This example uses MVVM and shows how fill a FIFO Series with data, shifting the XAxis.VisibleRange by 50% when the trace reaches the right edge.

    The example can run indefinitely as the FIFO chart series automatically discards points that are outside the viewport.

    A refresh rate of 50Hz is used and a shader effect is applied to provide a slight glow to the series to simulate the trace glow on an oscilloscope VDU.
    
    [b]Note:[/b] ECG data is a simulation.
