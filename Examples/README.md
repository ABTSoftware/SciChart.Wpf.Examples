## Build Instructions

> To compile the Examples App, you will need:
> 
> - To start a SciChart WPF Trial [find out how](https://www.scichart.com/getting-started/scichart-wpf) or purchase a license.
>    - Although the examples app will work without a trial license, modifying or creating your own examples won't
> - To setup the NuGet package source before you can compile. Here's How 
>  
>    1. After cloning the repo, open **SciChart2D3D.Examples.sln** found in the [/Examples](Examples) folder in Visual Studio.
>    2. Setup the Nuget Package source. While SciChart is hosted on Nuget.org, Hotfix builds (required for this examples app repo) are hosted at MyGet. 
>       * In Visual Studio go to Tools -> Options -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Sources
>       * Add a Package Source called "SciChart Hotfixes"
>       * Set the feed URL to https://www.myget.org/F/abtsoftware-bleeding-edge/api/v3/index.json, like this
